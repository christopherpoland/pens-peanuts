<p>Hola friends and family!
<br><br>
As I promised, I will be sending weekly updates on my travels over the next few months. I am now settled in La Cruz, Chile and have access to a computer so I will be tentatively sending these updates each Tuesday. This email includes my first three weeks in Chile and the numbers refer to the photo number in the attached files.
<br>
Emailing is painfully slow on my phone, so please message me on WhatsApp using my Canadian number if you want to hear more :)
<br>
Also, please excuse any spelling mistakes. I can´t figure out how to change the default language to English yet. I also don´t know how to make the 'at' sign on the keyboard here. But anyway, these emails wont be as long as this after this week.
<br><br>
Week 1: Tuesday, March 6 - Monday, March 12
<br><br>
I flew on a small plane London --> Toronto (just 8 passengers) then direct from Toronto --> Santiago (11 hours). I watched two movies and hardly slept, but I was very happy to be awake as the plane flew over the equator. I heard the first time you cross the equator by boat, you need to jump into the water. I settled for spilling some water onto my forearm.
<br>
'Hey Jeff, what´s the first photo you took?'
<br>
It is photo 1. This is when I went to the bathroom after waiting 90 minutes to pee because I didn´t want to wake the kind ladies sleeping next to me. I had the window seat. I also couldn´t find one of my shoes at the time, so I balanced on one foot as I swayed around in the tiny airplane bathroom. I´m not proud of this sequence of events, but I am also not ashamed.
<br>
Next, I safely made it to my hostel - Hostal Providencia. I quickly realized that English is not commonly spoken in this country. I stayed in this hostel for 3 nights and they provided free breakfast. During these three days, I took time to get to know downtown Santiago. Photo 2 is from the top of Cerro San Crisobal. (Cerro is Spanish for hill, but this is like a small mountain) I did this hike with a nice guy named Guthrie from Brighton, England and he was born in Whitehorse, Yukon. Photo 3 is a cool alley full of local art and fruit for sale.
<br>
On Saturday morning, I moved in with my first host family who was a man named Richard. He is in 50s, but I believe he is much younger because of his energy and the twinkle in his eyes. He works at the Museum of Natural History and loves to dance, listen to music, and cook (sometimes with just his boxers on). He is also a big fan of ´Fairly Odd Parents'. On Saturday afternoon, I went to his dance class which was 5 hours long! I tried to follow along as Richard instructed traditional dances from Chile, Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina to the class of 15 participants. Needless to say, I slept really well that night. The view from my bedroom can be seen in photo 7.
<br>
On Monday, I started my training week where I learned about Chilean culture and learned some Spanish. We also observed some classes at a school in Santiago and taught a small lesson to them. Photo 4 is myself with the 5 other teachers, and some of our instructors. The big guy in the middle that you might want to hug is called Patricio, but he also goes by Pato. (Spanish for duck)
<br><br>
Week 2: Tuesday, March 13 - Monday, March 19
<br><br>
The best part of training week was teaching the lesson. Myself and a co-teacher taught a fourth grade class how to say 'Hi, my name is ____' and 'I like to ____'. We put it into song to the tune of the 'Boom De Yada' song from the Discovery Channel. The students are very excited to meet us and many will hug and kiss us before and after class. Photo 12 shows one of the gifts I recieved from students.
<br>
After the training activities ended each afternoon, I would explore the city with the other teachers. Photo 5 is a typical cool street in Santiago and it reminds me of Montreal. The rest of my free time I spent with Richard. We went for walks in the park each night, and he cooked a lot of terrific food. He helped improve my Spanish, and I helped improve his English (which was better than my Spanish). Photo 10 is from one of our evening walks in the park. (near Parque de Los Reyes) On Tuesday night, I phoned Amelia for her birthday and she and Richard got to meet.
<br>
On my last night in Santiago, Richard and I went out for dinner in Barrio Yungay. Photo 11 is of the sun setting in this neighborhood which also reminds me of Monteral. Photo 8 shows how cute Richard is, and Photo 9 shows how cool the sandwich shop was. If you look closely, you can see a random dude blowing his nose. Richard and I had wine together nearly every night with dinner, and a little bit of ice cream certainly every night. On Saturday morning, I said bye to Richard and Santiago. But this was just goodbye for now, because I will see him again before I fly out of Santiago.
<br>
I moved in with my next host family in La Cruz on Saturday afternoon. This is a family of 3. The mom and dad are Paulina and Diego, and their son, Benjamin, is 10. They are very kind, welcoming, and funny. They also don´t speak any English, so I never know for sure what I am agreeing to, but things always seem to work out right. This family hosted another teacher like me last year. Her name is Charlotte and she started of with zero Spanish and learned to understand the family by the end. This was the best news I heard all day.
<br>
Photo 13 is my bedroom here. The window is always open (this is an avocado tree just beside my bed), and though the days are hot, the nights are pleasantly cool and I enjoy listening to the trains pass as I fall asleep. If you look closely you can see my Kitchi hat on my bed and the sheets on the wall which are my Spanish notes. I met an English teacher (who teaches private classes amongst other jobs), and he is helping me with my Spanish. I am also helping him improve his English. His name is Sebastian (Seba) and we plan to meet up about 2-3 times per week. One day, he wants to visit Canada.
<br>
Two things that are extremely prevalent in Chile are feral dogs and unhealthy foods. Photo 6 captures both of these as a dog naps in the shade in front of a churro truck. The most common fast foods here are hot dogs, empanadas, and ice cream. The most famous type of hot dog is called a `completo' - a fresh bun with two weiners, gobs of mayo, tons  of fresh avocado, and tomatoes.
<br>
Monday was my first at my new school - Colegio San Ignacio. It is in the next town south called Quillota, so I take the city bus to and from school each day.  It is a private school with grades from kindergarten to grade 12. I will be teaching here for 10 weeks and the first week is just for me to introduce myself and get to know the students.
<br><br>
Week 3: Tuesday, March 20 - Tuesday, March 27
<br><br>
This week was a blast with the students. I am officially an assistant teacher but the head teachers like to let me lead the classes. I teach 18 classes per week, and teach 2 classes per grade from grade 4 - 12. I don´t think any of the kids have ever met a Canadian, so they were all quite excited to ask me questions and hear about myself and Canadian culture. Photo 16 is a view from the school. The peak in the distance is part of a park called La Campana (Spanish for the bell), and I plan to do this hike in the coming weeks. It will take aroun 5 hours I hear.
<br>
On Wednesday night, I went for a run and ended up in a strange neighborhood. That is where I met this horse (photo 14) which was running through the streets. On the way home I bought some delicious fresh fruit. Speaking of fresh food, there is lots of great local produce to eat here and bakeries on nearly every street corner. Photo 15 is a delcious snack I had after school featuring fresh bread, avocado, and a fruit called pepino. My town, La Cruz, is the avocado capital of Chile and perhaps one of the best places in the world to get them.
<br>
The first two weeks, I get Tuesdays off. My days off will be mostly devoted to practicing Spanish and keeping in touch with you.
<br>
There are some really cool bars in Quilloa. My favourite so far is called Greiscol, which features 4 craft beers, free peanuts, and a small food menu. They only play old rock music (Spanish and English songs), and they have a portrait of David Gilmour from Pink Floyd hanging on the wall (Photo 17). The weather is always good here. Photo 18 shows the night sky as the sun is setting over the town centre in Quillota.
<br>
This past Saturday, it was the first birthday of Paulina's nephew, Dante. He threw a great party. It went for around 8 hours and at least 50 people came to celebrate! Since I couldn´t really communicate with the older family members, I spent most of the party with young children between the ages of 5 and 10. We played soccer and I went all out.
<br>
Yesterday, I had my first day of real classes. I taught about school vocabulary, different types of past tenses, and how much vs. how many in the grade 4, 12, and 6 classes. The topics of the lesssons were the Canadian school day, my musical career, and what the contents of my fridge are.
<br>
Today, I visited Vina del Mar for the afternoon. I saw the pacific ocean for the first time and dipped my feet in. It wasn´t as cold as I thought. Photo 20 is a castle on the shore. Unfortunately it was a cloudy day, so I couldn´t see too far. However, I will be back! The ocean is only 30-45 minutes away by car from my 'house'.
<br>
If you are wondering what I look like now, check out photo 19. Another teacher drew this for the class before I entered and I think it´s pretty good.
<br><br>
Until next week!
<br><br>
- Jeff
<br><br>
(Or as Chileans pronounce it - Yeph)
